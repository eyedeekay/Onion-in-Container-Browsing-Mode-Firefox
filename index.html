<h1>Onion in Container Tabs Mode for Firefox</h1>

<p>This is an extremely experimental, extremely unofficial project to enable
browsing .onion sites and clearnet sites via Tor in regular Firefox. The
strongest privacy protection for this activity is still Tor Browser and will
be for a long time. To get Tor Browser, go here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download">Tor Browser</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this extension is to experiment with side-by-side integration of
Tor and I2P in mainline Firefox and potentially, a hardened Firefox
distribution.</p>

<p>This is a meager prototype, it lacks functionality and shouldn't be used under
any circumstances to protect your anonymity at this time. If and or when that
becomes an option, the contexts in which that is true will be made clear.</p>

<h2>Super Extra Important Background Info:</h2>

<p>This plugin's viability is directly related to the viability of Mozilla and
Tor's work on hardening Firefox itself and of particular interest are the
"Uplift" and "Fusion(Firefox Using Onions)" projects.</p>
