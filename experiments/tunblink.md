Usage with standalone HTTP Proxy
--------------------------------

This functionality is currently disabled.

I developed a simple HTTP proxy that can be used with this extension to enable the
user to initiate a re-start of the HTTP proxy tunnel, with a new set of keys and a
new destination. This, combined with re-setting the browser settings back to the
original defaults(which is also done by the HTTP Proxy when re-initiated), amounts
to a "Fresh Identity" feature for the Onion browser.

Before you begin, get the [Standalone HTTP proxy from here](http://github.com/eyedeekay/httptunnel)
and run it like so:

        httpproxy -littleboss=start

You can also use 'go get'

        go get -u github.com/eyedeekay/httptunnel/httpproxy

If you change the default host and port, you will need to alter the following guide.

In order to use it with the custom HTTP proxy, open the "Add-On's" menu and select
the options for the onionsetproxy.js plugin. Change the "Proxy" configuration from

        Host: 127.0.0.1
        Port: 9050

to

        Host: 127.0.0.1
        Port: 7950

and change the "Control" configuration from:

        Host: 127.0.0.1
        Port: 9050

to

        Host: 127.0.0.1
        Port: 7951

Now, when you press the Toopie button in the toolbar, you will see in the output
of the HTTP proxy that it has been re-started.
