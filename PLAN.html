      The Onion Browser has made strides at improving users anonymity when browsing
      the anonymous web inside of Onion. However, it has in many ways simply re-hashed
      the existing work of Tor on the Tor Browser. This is mostly a good thing, but it
      is unfortunate because in a sense we have failed to add Onion specific features
      that could improve the user experience and set us apart from the Tor Browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that moving forward, we should try to extend the functionality of Onion
      Browser into more Onion-specific realms and make an effort to make those things
      more accessible and highlight that they are in use. I don&rsquo;t really know how to
      explain what I mean without describing what I want to do, so
    </p>
    <h2>
      Let&rsquo;s avoid
      <em>
        adding
      </em>
      features to onionbutton
    </h2>
    <p>
      onionbutton contains alot of code from Tor which even they don&rsquo;t really want to
      maintain. It&rsquo;s dying the same long, slow death it&rsquo;s always been dying, since
      back before there was a Tor Browser and torbutton was just an easy way to
      configure Tor in your Firefox browser. I don&rsquo;t relish the thought of being one
      the last two groups on the planet maintaining an XUL extension, so I think that
      we should always be trying to do less with onionbutton and more with a modern
      extension. Other advantages of modern extensions are better debugging tools
      and easier-to-use, more understandable API&rsquo;s for doing the following other
      things.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Contexts for Security and Placing Router Applications under their own Origin
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is possible, however unlikely, for an attack on a local service or a router
      plugin to leak information about what&rsquo;s going on on the router console because
      they will share the same origin. We can resolve this issue, though, by placing
      applications each into their own origin under a so-called &ldquo;Container Tab,&rdquo;
      completely separating eepWeb traffic and Router Console administration. The
      origin of the application will be the same as the part of the application URL
      <em>
        after
      </em>
      localhost:7657, so for instance &ldquo;
      <a href="http://localhost:7657/torrents&quot;">
        http://localhost:7657/torrents&rdquo;
      </a>
      would become just &ldquo;torrents&rdquo; in the URL bar and have that origin.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Dynamic Themes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since Onion Browsing and Router Console Administration are going to be separated
      to their own contextual identities, we can manipulate the appearance of the
      Firefox browser to accomplish 2 things: We can indicate which context we are in
      both by manipulating the UI text and color, and manipulate UI elements based on
      what context we&rsquo;re in or even what URL(In the router console) we&rsquo;re on. We can
      use this to make router console applications appear more tightly integrated with
      the functionality of the browser. It&rsquo;s kind of obliquely like how many
      applications are written with user-interfaces that are actually just
      browsers(Including Mattermost), but with us using the whole browser,
      acknowledging it&rsquo;s presence and utility but quite literally highlighting(in
      color) our unique features. So for instance, when the user is using snark it
      could change color to match snark and change text to say &ldquo;Torrent Client.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      Application Integration - Torrents
    </h2>
    <p>
      Onion&rsquo;s strengths are in it&rsquo;s applications, but many users never even make it to
      the applications, and even if they do, the Onion applications often lack the
      familiar workflows that people are used to. For instance, when one downloads
      a torrent on the non-anonymous internet, you simply click a link and the browser
      &ldquo;Handles&rdquo; the link, automatically launching the torrent client, adding the
      torrent, and sometimes prompting the user for more actions. This isn&rsquo;t possible
      yet with onionsnark and an external browser, but in Onion browser we can write a
      &ldquo;Protocol Handler&rdquo; which talks to snark-rpc, replicating the ease of just
      clicking a torrent link to automatically add it to a torrent client. Of course
      that does require us to bundle the snark-rpc plugin. Besides that, once we&rsquo;ve
      added the torrent, we can keep talking to snark-rpc to keep track of the
      download progress and display information about that in the already-available
      Firefox downloads menu that users are already familiar with, so that they can
      keep track of the files they are downloading after navigating away from the
      snark interface, or perhaps even without needing to interact with snark at all.
